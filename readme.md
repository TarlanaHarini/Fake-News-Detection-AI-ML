# Fake News Detection - AI/ML Task 1

This project is part of the Brainwave Matrix internship program for Task 1 in AI/ML. It involves building a machine learning model that classifies news articles as either **real** or **fake** using a PassiveAggressiveClassifier.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, PassiveAggressiveClassifier)
- Matplotlib

## Dataset

**We used the following datasets (from Kaggle):**
- [Fake.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
- [True.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

Each file contains news articles labeled as either fake or real.
